# APC-Library

Hi all, this is our 2nd Advanced topic for Advanced Programming Concepts. For this topic we are going to dive head-first into two types of standard library types, the `pair` and the `set` type.

We have all used various types of containers provided by the C++ standard library before. These containers are the foundation of data storage and manipulation in our C++ programs.
The C++ standard library takes away the need to set these containers up yourself.

Where this is good on one hand, the fact that these container types are given to us ready to be used can cause you to make mistakes in implementing the containers, as you might not fully understand the basics behind them.

To fix this potential lack of knowledge, we will dive into std::vector and std::pair of the C++ standard library.
We will first look into how these containers are implemented in the standard library, after which we will implement our own (basic) version of the containers.
